### License and Credits
Every single addition included in the module is either made entirely by me (about 95% are OC, though I might sometimes take inspiration from existing items) or made by someone else. If it is made by someone else, I added them with the permission of the author(s) or because they were released under a license that grants use and distribution as long as credit is given. I also include the handle of the original author(s). I do NOT claim any of those works as my own, and I always give credit where credit is due. Furthermore, I highly recommend that you check out the original authors, because they make WAY more stuff. I especially recommend [Rudok's Tavern](https://rudokstavern.com/), [Bonus Action](https://www.patreon.com/bonusaction), and [The Griffon's Saddlebag](https://www.thegriffonssaddlebag.com/). If you like the art for the Deck of Many Things, you can buy them in carstock from [VyseriArt](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/475517402/deck-of-many-things-dungeons-dragons-add?ref=shop_home_active_2).
